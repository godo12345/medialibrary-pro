## Picking the right component

Next you need to decide which components suits your needs most. We have two components available:

### Attachments

This is the simplest component. It allows you to upload one or more files.

### Collections

This component is more advanced. It allows you to upload multiple files with custom properties and functionality like sorting.
The files uploaded in this component are attached to a model. This component is perfect for managing media in admin panels.

## Getting a license

You must buy a license on [the Media Library Pro product page](https://spatie.be/products/media-library-pro) at spatie.be

Single application licenses maybe installed in a single Laravel app. In case you bought the unlimited application license, there are no restrictions. A license comes with one year of upgrades. If a license expires, you are still allowed to use Media Library Pro, but you won't get any updates anymore.

## What happens when your license expires?

A few days before a license expires, we'll send you a reminder mail to renew your license.

Should you decide not to renew your license, you won't be able to use composer anymore to install this package. You won't get any new features or bug fixes.

Instead, you can download a zip containing the latest version that your license covered. This can be done on  [your purchases page on spatie.be](https://spatie.be/profile/purchases). You are allowed to host this version in a private repo of your own.

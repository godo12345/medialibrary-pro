## Our demo application

If you are unsure how to do something you can have a look at our [demo application](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-medialibrary-pro-app). This application is a fully functional Laravel app that demonstrates how to use Media Library Pro. It's a great way to see how everything works together.

The demo application contains examples for Blade, Livewire, React and Vue.js.

## The issue tracker

When buying a license you will gain access to the private repository for Media Library Pro on Github. This repository contains an issue tracker where you can ask questions, report bugs and suggest new features.
If you are having problems the issue tracker is a good place to look for people who experienced the same problems.

## Email support

If none of the above options work for you, you can always email us at [support@spatie.be](mailto:support@spatie.be).
